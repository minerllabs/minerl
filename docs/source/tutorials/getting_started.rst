================
Installation
================

Welcome to MineRL! This guide will get you started.


To start using the data and set of reinforcement learning
enviroments comrpising MineRL, you'll need to install the
main python package, :code:`minerl`.

.. _OpenJDK 8: https://openjdk.java.net/install/
.. _Windows installer: https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html
.. _Mac installer: 

1. First **make sure you have JDK 1.8** installed on your
   system.

   a. `Windows installer`_  -- On windows go this link and follow the
      instructions to install JDK 8.

   b. On mac, with homebrew installed you can use the following::

        brew tap caskroom/versions
        brew cask install java8  

   c. On Debian based systems (Ubuntu!) you can run the following::

        sudo add-apt-repository ppa:openjdk-r/ppa
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk

2. Now install the :code:`minerl` package!::

        pip3 install --upgrade minerl

        
**That's it! Now you're good to go :) ðŸ’¯ðŸ’¯ðŸ’¯**


===============================
Your First Agent
===============================

With the :code:`minerl` package installed on your system you can
now make your first agent in Mineraft!

To get started, let's first import the necessary packages 

.. code-block:: python

    import gym
    import minerl

    # Run random agent through environment
    env = gym.make(environment) # or try 'MineRLObtainDiamond-v0'

    obs, info = env.reset()
    done = False
    
    while not done:
            action = env.action_space.sample()  # Generate a random action for the agent
            action['camera'] *= 0.1 # Full turn speed is quite fast for humans
            action['forward'] = 1   # Let's move forward in every step
            action['bacward'] = 0   # without this we may stand still sometimes
            obs, reward, done, info = env.step(action)
            if reward != 0:
            print(reward)
    print("MISSION DONE") 

Sampling The Dataset
===============================

Now that your agent can act randomly in the enviroments, we should 
show it how to leverage human demonstrations.

To get started, let's ensure the data has been downloaded

.. code-block:: python

    import minerl

    minerl.data.download('/your/local/path')

Now we can build the datast for :code:`MineRLObtainDiamond-v0`

.. code-block:: python

    import minerl

    data = minerl.data.make('MineRLObtainDiamond-v0', data_dir='/your/local/path/data_texture_0_low_res')
    
    # Iterate through a single epoch using batches of 32 steps
    for act, obs, rew, done in data.batch_iter(num_epochs=1, batch_size=32):
        print("Act shape:", len(act), act)
        print("Obs shape:", len(obs), obs)
        print("Rew shape:", len(rew), rew)





.. note:: 
    Hard-coding the data directory is bad practice. For portability, plese define 
    :code:`MINERL_DATA_ROOT` as :code:`/your/local/path/data_texture_0_low_res`. 
    A demonstration on how to set the JAVA_HOME environment variable can be found
    `here <https://www.baeldung.com/java-home-on-windows-7-8-10-mac-os-x-linux>`_, 
    simply replace JAVA_HOME with MINERL_DATA_ROOT and /path/to/java_installation with
    /your/local/path/data_texture_0_low_res
