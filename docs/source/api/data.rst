The :code:`minerl.data` package provides a unified interface for
sampling data from the `MineRL-v0 Dataset`. Data is accessed by 
making a dataset from one of the minerl environments and iterating 
over it using one of the iterators provided by the :code:`minerl.data.DataPipeline`

The following is a description of the various methods included within the package
as well as some basic usage examples. To see more detailed
`descriptions and tutorials`_ on how to use the data API, please
`take a look at our numerous getting started manuals`_.
