MineRL BASALT Competition Environments
=======================================
*The videos on this page do not represent the new MineRL environment or the new dataset.*

In the Benchmark for Agents that Solve Almost-Lifelike Task (BASALT) 
competition, your task is to solve tasks based on human judgement, 
instead of pre-defined reward functions. The goal is to produce agents that are 
judged by real humans to be effective at solving a given task. This calls for 
training on human-feedback, whether it is training from demonstrations, training on human preferences or using humans to correct agentsâ€™ actions.
